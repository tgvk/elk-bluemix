# Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana (ELK) Docker image for IBM Bluemix Development and Deployment


This Docker image is a complete log management stack that is intended to be deployed on IBM Bluemix containers, managing 
the logs of Bluemix applications, specifically during development.  It provides a quick easy way to manage and monitor 
Bluemix applications, providing debugging information useful in tracking down intermittent and long running issues.

This image is not intended to be used in production loads, where it might make more sense to manage separate containers for each component.

This image uses  Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, collectively known as ELK.

### Documentation
